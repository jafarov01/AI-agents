# Workflow Validation Summary

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. GitHub Issue Integration
- **Fixed**: Orchestrator now supports `#1`, `#2` syntax for GitHub issues
- **Added**: `getIssue()` and `updateIssue()` functions in `lib/github.js`
- **Improved**: Issue status tracking with labels (`in-progress`, `ready-for-review`)

### 2. Dependency Validation
- **Added**: Comprehensive dependency checks in all agents
- **Validates**: GEMINI_API_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_OWNER, GITHUB_REPO
- **Provides**: Clear error messages with setup instructions

### 3. Bootstrap Improvements
- **Fixed**: Proper remote origin setup using HTTPS URLs
- **Added**: Automatic `.env` file creation with repo variables
- **Improved**: Sequential GitHub issue creation with proper numbering

### 4. Security Enhancements
- **Added**: Input sanitization for logs and file paths
- **Fixed**: Path traversal vulnerabilities
- **Improved**: Error handling and validation

## üîÑ Proper SDLC Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning
```bash
npx ngen
```
**Dependencies**: GEMINI_API_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_OWNER
**Output**: 
- GitHub repo with remote origin
- Numbered GitHub issues (#1, #2, #3...)
- Project scaffold with .env file

### Phase 2: Development
```bash
node orchestrator.js "#1"  # Work on specific GitHub issue
node orchestrator.js "#2"  # Next ticket
```
**Dependencies**: GITHUB_REPO, issue exists, clean working directory
**Process**:
1. Fetches GitHub issue details
2. Creates feature branch: `feature/issue-N-description`
3. Updates issue label to "in-progress"
4. Generates tests based on issue description
5. Implements code to pass tests (TDD)
6. Performs AI code review
7. Creates PR that closes the issue
8. Updates issue label to "ready-for-review"

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependency Requirements

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_from_google_ai_studio
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_with_repo_workflow_scopes
GITHUB_OWNER=your_github_username
GITHUB_REPO=project_name  # Set automatically by bootstrap
```

### GitHub Token Scopes
- ‚úÖ `repo` (full repository access)
- ‚úÖ `workflow` (GitHub Actions access)

### System Requirements
- ‚úÖ Node.js 18+
- ‚úÖ Git configured
- ‚úÖ npm/yarn package manager

## üö® Error Handling

### Common Errors & Solutions

**"Missing required environment variables"**
- Check `.env` file exists and has all required variables
- Verify API keys are correct and active

**"403 Forbidden" (GitHub)**
- Token needs `repo` and `workflow` scopes
- Check token hasn't expired
- Verify GITHUB_OWNER matches your username exactly

**"Issue #N not found"**
- Run `npx ngen` first to create GitHub issues
- Ensure you're working in the correct repository

**"GITHUB_REPO missing"**
- Ensure you're in the project directory
- Check `.env` file was created by bootstrap
- Verify remote origin is set up

## üìã Validation Checklist

Before using the agents, ensure:

- [ ] `.env` file exists with all required variables
- [ ] GitHub token has correct scopes
- [ ] Gemini API key is active
- [ ] Git is configured with your credentials
- [ ] Working directory is the project root
- [ ] Remote origin is configured (after bootstrap)

## üéØ Success Indicators

When everything is working correctly:
- ‚úÖ `npx ngen` creates repo and issues without errors
- ‚úÖ `node orchestrator.js "#1"` fetches issue and starts development
- ‚úÖ Feature branches are created automatically
- ‚úÖ Tests are generated and pass
- ‚úÖ PRs are created with proper issue linking
- ‚úÖ Issue labels are updated automatically

The workflow now properly implements professional SDLC practices with AI automation while maintaining traceability and proper dependency management.
